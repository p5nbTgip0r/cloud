# Contributing to cloud

Before contributing to the library, you are highly encouraged to join our Discord (linked in the README) to discuss the changes.
For your code to be approved, we ask of you the following:
- Attempt to follow the project code style. In the repository there is an `.editorconfig` file which has been setup to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use our code style.
If you use another editor, you might have to do some manual formatting. Small deviations are not necessarily a big deal, but do your best.
- Make sure that your code is tested & fully functional. If possible, create a test file as well.
- Feel free to add yourself to the copyright notice in the file license header, for the files that you have added and/or edited. 
Also attach to each file a license header, using the text in the LICENSE file.
- Try to limit the scope of your PR. It is better to create two PRs, than to include irrelevant changes in one.
- Please document your public methods and add nullability annotations to all method return types, and method parameters. 

We highly appreciate all contributions to the project and we look forward to seeing yours!
